# Compute List Average

Write the functionality for the `compute_average() function
defined in `compute_list_avg.py`.

We have provided the method docstring which describes the behavior the
function needs to implement.

We have created a [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) 
class in `test_compute_list.py`   

You can run the tests in this file with -
```bash
python3 -m unittest test_compute_list.py 
```

Once your `compute_average()` function passes the test cases, 
submit your work for grading.
