# Power Recursion

Write a recursive function `power(x, y)` in  a file `power.py` 
which computes `x` to the `y` power.

*Note*: While `0` to the `0` is undefined in mathematics, we specify 
that `0` to the `0` shall be `1` for this function.  

You may assume `y` is a nonnegative integer.

To test your work, write a file named `test_power.py`. This file should 
import your function. We have used this pattern in previous assignments.

You MUST use recursion (no iteration). What is your base case? How do you
make problem smaller?

Once you've validated your recursive implementation of power,
submit `power.py` for grading.
