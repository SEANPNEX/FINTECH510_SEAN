# Algorithm

This problem is intended to help you practice translating from handwritten
algorithms to Python code.

1. Review your algorithm from the initial 'algorithm' assignment
2. Write a Python function, `series18(N)` in the `series18.py` that computes 
   and prints the correct output, e.g.:
   ```
    > series18(1)
    -1 0 3
    > series18(3)
    -9 -8 -5 0 7 16 27 40 55
   ```

3. Test the code, make sure it works for, e.g.  N=6, N=7, and N=10.

   We have provided a sample test.py that you can use to execute your series18(N) function.
   ```bash  
   python3 test.py
   ```

 4. Submit `series18.py` for grading when you are complete.
