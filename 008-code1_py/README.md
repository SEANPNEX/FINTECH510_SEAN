# Code 1: Maximum Function

Write a Python script that contains a function `my_max` that determines which of the two parameters is larger and returns that parameter as the result.  

Python does have a built-in function `max()`.  You may not use that function as part of your answer.

We have provided a file `code.py`. In `my_max()`, the algorithm is written
as a docstring, but without any code. Translate this algorithm to code.

The bottom of script contains three print statements which call `my_max()` 
and print its result.  These statements let you check if `my_max()` works
correctly.

The script also contains a comment asking you to write one more print 
statement with a call to `my_max()`.  In that comment, it asks you to take
the max of two numbers (written as hex), and print them out.
Add a line of code to do this.

Sample Execution:
```bash
$ python3 code.py
max(42, -69): 42
max(33, 0): 33
max(0x123456, 123456): 1193046
max(0x451215AF, 0x913591AF): 2436207023
```

If your output matches the above sample, submit `code.py` for grading.

Otherwise, try to fix the problem (and ask for help if you cannot).
