# Hello Python

Your goal in this assignment is to produce a program that displays 
your email address on the screen. 

>The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. 
>The first program is the same for all languages: Print the words 'hello, world' 
>
>This is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere,
>compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went.

This assignment validates that you have your Python environment correctly established and,
by making a slight change to the text, we also validate that we corrrectly configured our grading environment
for the students.

You need to create a file called `hello.py` that has the following content:
```python
print("your_email_address")
```

where *your_email_address* is replaced by your actual Duke email address.

To execute this program from the command-line, type
```
$ python3 hello.py
```
Note: The `$` is a prompt, indicating that the shell program is waiting for us to type a command in that space.

Within VSCode, you can also click on the "Play" icon in the upper right-hand corner to execute the program.

Once you have validated that your program executes correctly, submit `hello.py` to Gradescope.
