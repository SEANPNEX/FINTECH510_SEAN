Prior to completing this quiz, perform the following activities:
1. Read Chapter 2 in 'Programming: Principles and Practice using C++', noting section 2.2 'The classic first program'
2. Complete the 'HelloWorld_cpp' exercise.
 
Answer the following questions:
1. Name the four parts of a function
2. What is the purpose of the #include directive?
3. What does the linker do for your program?
4. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?
5. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to practice?
6. Create Section 2.3's '// no #include here' error in your code, and paste the compiler error message here.
7. Create Section 2.3's '// non-terminated string' error in your code, and paste the compiler error message here.
8. Create Section 2.3's '// wrong type name: 'integer' rather than 'int'' error in your code, and paste the compiler error message here.
9. Create Section 2.3's '// wrong operator: '<' rather than '<<'' error in your code, and paste the compiler error message here.
10. Create Section 2.3's '// missing semicolon, ';', at end of output statement' error in your code, and paste the compiler error message here.

The hello_(x+1).cpp versions correspond to the Gradescope questions 
for the PPP Chapter 2 Reading Quiz

To compile:
1. open a terminal window (Terminal -> new window in VS Code menu)
2. change to the assignment directory in the terminal window
   - `pwd` - displays/prints the current(present) working directory
   - `ls` - lists the files in that directory
   - `cd <directoryName>`  - changes to that directory
   - `cd ..` - changes to the parent directory
3. To compile hello_7.cpp: `g++ -std=c++17 hello_7.cpp`

Only copy the first error message displayed. As you compile C++ programs, 
you should only focus on fixing the first error message, then re-compile
the program.
