The hello_x.cpp versions correspond to the Gradescope questions 
for the PPP Chapter 2 Reading Quiz

To compile:
1. open a terminal window (Terminal -> new window in VS Code menu)
2. change to the assignment directory in the terminal window
   pwd - displays/prints the current(present) working directory
   ls - lists the files in that directory
   cd <directoryName>  - changes to that directory
   cd .. - changes to the parent directory
3. To compile hello_7.cpp: g++ -std=c++17 hello_7.cpp

Only copy the first error message displayed. As you compile C++ programs, 
you should only focus on fixing the first error message, then re-compile
the program.
