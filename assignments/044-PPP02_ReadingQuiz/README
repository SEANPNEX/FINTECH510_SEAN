The hello_x.cpp versions correspond to the Gradescope questions 
for the PPP Chapter 2 Reading Quiz

1. Name the four parts of a function
2. What is the purpose of the #include directive?
3. What does the linker do for your program?
4. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?
5. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to practice?
6. Attempt to compile hello_7.cpp and provide the error message.
7. Attempt to compile hello_8.cpp and provide the error message.
8. Attempt to compile hello_9.cpp and provide the error message.
9. Attempt to compile hello_10.cpp and provide the error message.
10. Attempt to compile hello_11.cpp and provide the error message.

To compile:
1. open a terminal window (Terminal -> new window in VS Code menu)
2. change to the assignment directory in the terminal window
   pwd - displays/prints the current(present) working directory
   ls - lists the files in that directory
   cd <directoryName>  - changes to that directory
   cd .. - changes to the parent directory
3. To compile hello_7.cpp: g++ -std=c++17 hello_7.cpp

Only copy the first error message displayed. As you compile C++ programs, 
you should only focus on fixing the first error message, then re-compile
the program.
