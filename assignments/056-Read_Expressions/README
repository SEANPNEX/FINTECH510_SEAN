Read Expressions:

1. Create a file "answer.txt".
2. Execute the code in code.cpp by hand as demonstrated with
   the memory/trace diagrams in class. 
   Write the output in your "answer.txt" file
3. Take a picture of your diagram.
4. Compile the program by using the provided Makefile.  
   (The C++ retirement assignment discussed how to do this.)
5. Execute the program: ./test
6. Compare the output to your expected output.  Make any corrections.
7. Submit answer.txt and your diagram (this can be png/jpg/pdf) to Gradescope.

Notes:
Something(int _x): x(_x) is a constructor that is called when a new 
instance of Something is created. This constructor initializes the state 
of the object, contained in the variable x to the parameter _x

~Something() is a destructor that is called when an object goes out of 
scope or a programmer explicitly destroys an object with the `delete` keyword.
