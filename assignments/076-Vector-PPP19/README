# Vector One - Chapter 19

In this assignment, you will enhance your `vector1.hpp` header file to include features described in Chapter 19

Steps:
1. Copy the `vector1.hpp`, `vector1_tests.cpp`, and `CMakeLists.txt` from the previous assignment (ppp_ch18_vector)
   to this assignment folder.
2. Implement `reserve()` as described in Section 19.2.2 of PPP. 
3. Implement `capacity()` as described in Section 19.2.2 of PPP.
4. Implement `resize()` as described in Section 19.2.3 of PPP.
5. Implement `push_back()` as described in Section 19.2.4 of PPP.
6. Implement the vector assignment operator `=` as described in Section 19.2.5
7. As necessary, add tests to `vector1_tests.cpp` to validate the newly implemented functionality
8. Run the following commands:
   ```
   cmake -S . -B build
   cmake --build build
   ```
9. Run the program 'build/vector1' and review the output. It should list all tests as successfully passed.
10. Submit `vector1.hpp` to the Gradescope assignment.

Note: You should alter `vector1_tests.cpp` to test locally, repeating steps 8 & 9 as necessary.
