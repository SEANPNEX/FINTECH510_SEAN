# Algorithm

*Note*: Time will be set aside explicitly to work on this with another student during class.

This problem is intended for you to practice the basics of algorithmic development and execution by hand that you learned in the initial Jupyter notebooks.

You need to do:

1. Find a partner.

2. Each of you should answer the following question:

   The numbers in the table below are the result of executing an algorithm
   which has one parameter, N, which must be a non-negative integer, and 
   produces a sequence of integers as output.

   For values of N from 0 to 5, the algorithm produces the following  sequences 
   of numbers as outputs:
   ```
   N   Output
   0	 
   1   -1 0 3
   2   -4 -3 0 5 12 21
   3   -9 -8 -5 0 7 16 27 40 55
   4   -16 -15 -12 -7 0 9 20 33 48 65 84 105
   5   -25 -24 -21 -16 -9 0 11 24 39 56 75 96 119 144 171
   ```

   Determine the algorithm that was used to generate the numbers in this 
   table and write it down (you should have at least two lines).

   Execute the algorithm for N = 6, and write down your result.

3. Discuss your answers with your partner.  Did you get the same answer? Was 
   something ambiguous in the algorithm? Did you find the pattern correctly?

4. In a file called `answer.txt`, place the following information:

   The first line should have your answer for N = 6. Each number 
   should be separated by single space.

   The second line should be blank.
   
   The remaining lines should document your algorithm.  At least two lines are expected.

5. Submit `answer.txt` for grading in Gradescope.
