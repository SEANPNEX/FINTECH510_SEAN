# Computation and Arithmetic

Given the following Python assignment statements:
```python
x = 5
d = 2.4
```

Determine the type and value of each of the following expressions,
and write them in a filed called `answers.txt`.  The type is either "int" or "float".

As an example, the first line in answers.txt:
```text
int 3
```

1. x - 2
2. x + d
3. x / 2
4. d + x / 4
5. x // 3
6. x + 0x2a
7. d + 0x2a
8. d * 2 // 3
