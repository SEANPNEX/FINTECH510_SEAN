# Triangles

Open the provided `triangles.py` file. You will see one function
`print_triangle`, along with some code that will call that function.

The `print_triangle` function has an algorithm written as comments, 
but no code. Translate this algorithm to code.

After the function, the script contains three statements:
  - printing a message of a triangle of height 4
  - calling `print_triangle` to print the triangle
  - printing the total number of stars in that triangle 
    (returned by the `print_triangle` function).

The script also has a comment asking you to write a few more statements 
to do the same thing for a triangle of height 7.
Add the code to do this.

Execute your code with `python3 triangles.py`.

If your program has any errors, the interpreter will do its best to describe
what is wrong. If a problem exists, look at the code  and try to see where
you did not follow the syntax rules from the different notebooks.  The line
number and message it gives may help you find the problem.  If you cannot
find the problem  after a few minutes, ask for help.

If your code has legal syntax, your program should run and produce output.
Compare this output with the output we expect.

If they are the same, submit your assignment for grading.

If they are not, try to fix the problem (and ask for help if you cannot).

## Expected output
```text
Here is a triangle with height 4
*
**
***
****
That triangle had 10 total stars
Here is a triangle with height 7
*

***
****
*****

That triangle had 28 total stars
```
